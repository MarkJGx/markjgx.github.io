![APEX which relies on PhysX working in Unreal Engine 5](/assets/videos/physxue5.mp4)

**Patch for 5.0.1 (branch #5.0)**: [https://github.com/MarkJGx/UnrealEngine/pull/1](https://github.com/MarkJGx/UnrealEngine/pull/1)

# The Preface:
I wanted to see if Unreal 5.0 could use PhysX without too much blood
sweat and tears, and it could. This is more of a hacky proof of concept than an
actually solid PhysX integration, but it works.

# The How?

This isn't a perfect re-integration of PhysX specifically when it comes
to the inclusion of the headers in PhysXIncludes.h. I opted to go for
simply and dirty solution of using the relative include paths instead.
I am not a fan of this approach and would like to address when I have
some more time. I did verify that the PhysX module does indeed
specify a valid include directory and that's where I left it.
I also took the liberty of stripping old references to VS2015 in the
physics modules ("PhysicsCore") but I suspect that might have some
issues.

Certain collision primitives on SM's won't be setup and won't work.
The underlying collision information is there it just isn't loaded
properly, recreating the collision will fix this.
This is just something I haven't gotten around to fixing due
to lack of time.

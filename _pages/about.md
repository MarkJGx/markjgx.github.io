I'm Mark J. G (go by: *markjg*, *MarkJGx*), a programmer/hacker. (circa ~2011). I primarily work in C++ and the occasional Rust when I'm blessed with the chance.

If you enjoy peculiar humour and extremely nerdy, in-depth technical topics -- then this is the blog for you! I think of this blog as my personal archive of documented execution and ideas, ranging from howtos to what I'm working on. 

I will do my best to guarantee that:
* There's always an RSS feed available for this blog.
* That'll it work without any JavaScript. 
* and on slow mobile devices with a touchscreen. 

If I don't catch something, please get in touch here: `contact (at) markjg (dot) com`

I also run the game development blog for my games' studio here:

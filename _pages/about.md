I'm Mark J. G (go by: *mjg*, MarkJGx), a full-time programmer of ~ 11 years (circa 2011). `C++/Rust` right now.

If you enjoy peculiar humour and extremely nerdy, in-depth technical topics, then this is the blog for you! I think of this blog as my personal archive of documented execution and ideas, ranging from howto's and what I'm working on. 

> I will do my best to guarantee that there's always an RSS feed available for this blog, that'll it work without any Javascript, and on slow mobile devices with a touchscreen. If I don't catch something, please get in touch here:
